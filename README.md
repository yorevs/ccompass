# C-Compass

## Orienting the disoriented :D

### This is a C-ANSI style framework to program in C like C++.

A long time ago I tried to create a framework to program in C-ANSI using OO concepts of Classes, Objects, Exceptions, Constructors, etc... Today I decided to open it for the nostalgic ones who want to see the beauties of the C language.

This work is not complete, mas it can give you an idea of what can ben done in C. I'm not a big fan of C++, but, object orienting is cool.
